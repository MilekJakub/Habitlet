The goal is the first entity that the user creates. It is the main entity that the user will use to build their roadmap.

SMART goal criteria:
- **Specific:** The goal should be precise without room for misinterpretation.
- **Measurable:** The goal should be quantifiable, and progress should be easy to track.
- **Achievable:** The goal should be attainable within a reasonable timeframe.
- **Relevant:** The goal should be relevant to the user's values and interests.
- **Time-bound:** The goal should have a defined end date.

Specific: user will follow instructions about how to define a specific goal, and use formula to define goal name and description.

Measurable: user will define roadmap with milestones and steps which will allow user to track progress.

Achievable: user will follow instructions about how to define a goal that is achievable.

Relevant: user will follow instructions about how to define a goal that is relevant to their values and interests.

Time-bound: user will create roadmap with milestones and steps (which will have time estimates) which will allow user to estimate time needed to achieve the goal.

Types of goal:
- Increase something
- Make something
- Improve something
- Reduce something
- Save something
- Develop someone (can be yourself)

What - Think about exactly what you are trying to accomplish and don't be afraid to get very detailed.

When - You'll get more specific about this question under the “time-bound” section of defining S.M.A.R.T. goals, but you should at least set a time frame.

Where - This question may not always apply, especially if you're setting personal goals, but if there's a location or relevant event, identify it here.

Which - Determine any related obstacles or requirements. This question can be beneficial in deciding if your goal is realistic. For example, if the goal is to open a baking business, but you've never baked anything before, that might be an issue. As a result, you may refine the specifics of the goal to be "Learn how to bake in order to open a baking business."

Why - What is the reason for the goal? When it comes to using this method for employees, the answer will likely be along the lines of company advancement or career development.

**Measurable**

There should be a source of information to measure or determine whether a goal has been achieved.
Fortunetaly we have a lot of tools to help us with this.

- Milestones
- Steps
- Habits
- Sessions

**Achievable**

This focuses on how important a goal is to you and what you can do to make it attainable and may require developing new skills and changing attitudes. The goal is meant to inspire motivation, not discouragement. Think about:
- how to accomplish the goal,
- if you have the tools/skills needed,
- if not, consider what it would take to attain them.

**Relevant**

Relevance refers focusing on something that makes sense with the broader goals of the user.
For example, if the goal is to learn a new language, it should be relevant to the user's interests and values.
If the user has no clear interest in the goal (he will not receive any benefit from achieving it), it will be hard for him to stay motivated.

**Time-bound**

Anyone can set goals, but if it lacks realistic timing, chances are you're not going to succeed.
Providing a target date for deliverables is imperative.
If the goal will take three months to complete, it's useful to define what should be achieved half-way through the process.
Fortunetaly using the roadmap we can define milestones and steps which will have time estimates.
That will help us to define a realistic timeline for the goal.
