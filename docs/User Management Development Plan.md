# User Management Development Plan

## Overview

The User Management context involves implementing features related to user registration, authentication, and profile management. This plan outlines the tasks required to develop these features.

## Tasks

### 1. User Registration

- **Task 1.1: Design Registration Form**
  - Create a wireframe for the registration form.
  - Define required fields (e.g., username, email, password).

- **Task 1.2: Implement Registration Backend**
  - Set up API endpoints for user registration.
  - Validate user input and handle errors.

- **Task 1.3: Develop Frontend Registration**
  - Implement the registration form in React.
  - Connect the form to the backend API.

### 2. User Authentication

- **Task 2.1: Design Login Form**
  - Create a wireframe for the login form.
  - Define required fields (e.g., email, password).

- **Task 2.2: Implement Authentication Backend**
  - Set up API endpoints for user login.
  - Implement JWT or session-based authentication.

- **Task 2.3: Develop Frontend Login**
  - Implement the login form in React.
  - Connect the form to the backend API.

### 3. Profile Management

- **Task 3.1: Design Profile Page**
  - Create a wireframe for the user profile page.
  - Define editable fields (e.g., username, email, avatar).

- **Task 3.2: Implement Profile Backend**
  - Set up API endpoints for fetching and updating user profiles.
  - Ensure secure access to user data.

- **Task 3.3: Develop Frontend Profile**
  - Implement the profile page in React.
  - Connect the page to the backend API for data fetching and updates.

### 4. Security and Validation

- **Task 4.1: Implement Input Validation**
  - Validate all user inputs on both frontend and backend.
  - Ensure strong password policies.

- **Task 4.2: Implement Security Measures**
  - Use HTTPS for secure data transmission.
  - Implement rate limiting and account lockout mechanisms.

### 5. Testing

- **Task 5.1: Write Unit Tests**
  - Write unit tests for all backend endpoints.
  - Write unit tests for frontend components.

- **Task 5.2: Conduct Integration Testing**
  - Test the complete user registration and login flow.
  - Ensure profile updates are correctly reflected.

## Timeline

- **Week 1-2:** Complete User Registration tasks.
- **Week 3-4:** Complete User Authentication tasks.
- **Week 5-6:** Complete Profile Management tasks.
- **Week 7:** Implement Security and Validation.
- **Week 8:** Conduct Testing and finalize the User Management context.
