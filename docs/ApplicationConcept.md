## Application Concept for Effective Goal Achievement

The key foundation of this application lies in the principles of *Atomic Habits*, which have proven to deliver impressive results.

---

### Core Concept Flow:
1. **Set a Goal**:
   The goal should be SMART. This means that it is specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound.
   Our identity should be aligned with a clear goal we aim to achieve.

2. **Create a Roadmap**:
   The roadmap is a step-by-step plan to achieve the goal. It is created using techniques from Event Storming.

3. **Define a New Identity**:  
   To create atomic habits, we need to first establish our identity.
   The identity is a description of the person we want to become.
   Based on the goal, we define the profile of a successful person by answering the questions like:  
   *"What kind of person is able to achieve this goal?"*
   *"What does this person do on a daily basis?"*
   *"What are the values of this person?"*
   *"What this person would never do?"*

4. **Analyze Behavior**:  
   With this identity in mind, we can identify the behaviors and actions of this successful person.

5. **Build Habits**:
   From the identified behaviors, we create habits that align with the identity.

### The Habit Loop:  
The habit loop consists of four essential stages:  
- **Cue (Make it obvious)**  
- **Craving (Make it attractive)**  
- **Response (Make it easy)**  
- **Reward (Make it satisfying)**  

---

### How to Apply These Principles in the App:

#### **1. Cue – Make it Obvious:**  
Use tools to remind and signal users to take action:  
- Push notifications

Motivate users through engaging and appealing features:  
- Gaining experience points (XP)  
- Maintaining streaks for habit completion  
- Light, friendly, and intuitive interface  
- Easy and smooth user experience  
- Public profiles to foster pride and accountability  
- Community support for motivation  
- Success stories from other users  
- App backed by scientific research  
- Endorsements by successful people  

#### **3. Response – Make it Easy:**  
Remove friction to ensure that users can act without obstacles:  
- App available at any time (offline access included)  
- Easy and seamless navigation  
- Clear, simple, and effective habits that bring users closer to their goals  
- Clear goals and a roadmap to guide next steps  

#### **4. Reward – Make it Satisfying:**

## Registration and Onboarding Flow

### **Step 1: User Registration**  
The user signs up in the application.

### **Step 2: Goal Creation**  
The user sets a personal goal they want to achieve.  
- The goal must meet **SMART criteria** (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound).  

### **Step 3: Personality Creation**  
Based on the goal, the user answers key questions to define the identity of the imagined person who has achieved this goal.

### **Step 4: Habit Creation**  
From the established personality, recurring behaviors are extracted. These represent the habits that the successful person would regularly perform.  
The user is also asked to answer four key questions:  
- *How can I make this obvious?*  
- *How can I make this attractive?*  
- *How can I make this easy?*  
- *How can I make this satisfying?*  

### **Step 5: Roadmap Creation**  
Once the goal is set, the user builds a roadmap toward it.  
- The user identifies who they want to become and how that person behaves.  
- Then, a step-by-step path is outlined to achieve the goal using techniques from **Big Picture Event Storming**.

### Time Tracker Integration

The application is built with user trust in mind. The time tracker, experience points, streaks, and other user progress elements are **not validated to prevent cheating** but rely on user honesty.

### **Time Tracker Features:**
- Sessions can be started and stopped live or added through the UI.  
- Sessions can be set as **Pomodoro** or **Timer:**  
  - **Pomodoro:** Ends automatically after a set time.  
  - **Timer:** Automatically stops after 24 hours.  
- Users can add sessions within a ±30-day time frame.


After a session ends, the user is presented with a Session Summary that highlights key metrics:
- Duration of the session
- XP earned during the session
- Habit streak status

Users are encouraged to reflect on the session by answering:
- "What went well?"
- "What can be improved?"

Progress bars and heatmaps are updated instantly to give a clear picture of growth and consistency.

If a milestone is completed, a congratulatory message appears, motivating the user to continue.

- **Positive Feedback:** Celebratory animations and motivational quotes after successful session completion.
- **Next Step Suggestions:** The app recommends the next habit or task aligned with the user’s goal to keep momentum.
- **Streak Continuation:** Users are informed of their current streak and how close they are to a significant streak milestone.

### **Automated Features for Seamless Continuity**

To ensure a smooth and engaging user experience, the app leverages automation to maintain momentum and encourage users to stay on track with their goals. These features are designed to blend effortlessly into the user's daily life, providing just-in-time reminders, adaptive progress adjustments, and insightful recaps.

### **1. Daily Reminders: Encouraging Consistency and Momentum**  
**Purpose:**  
Daily reminders are designed to gently nudge users into action, helping them maintain their streaks and continue developing habits. The reminders are not intrusive but customized to fit the user's schedule and preferences.

**Key Features:**  
- **Smart Notifications:** Messages that encourage users to complete the next session based on their habit history and progress.

**Example:**  
*"Ready to continue building your identity? Take just 5 minutes to solidify your habits!"*

---

### **2. Progressive Adjustments: Adaptive Goal Management**  
**Purpose:**  
If a user struggles or their performance drops, the app automatically adjusts their goals and habits to help them regain momentum. The goal is to reduce friction, rebuild confidence, and prevent burnout.  

**How It Works:**  
- **Adaptive Goals:** If the app detects a decline in habit completion, it offers easier, incremental goals.  
    - **Example:** If a user misses several sessions, the next reminder suggests a shorter session with reduced expectations, like shifting from a 30-minute workout to a 5-minute stretch.  
- **Celebrating Small Wins:** Even minor achievements are acknowledged to reinforce positive behavior and build momentum.  
- **Recovery Plans:** Tailored plans are created to help users bounce back after setbacks, with encouraging messages and practical next steps.  
    - **Example:** *"Missed a few days? No worries! Let’s get back on track today."*  

---

### **3. End-of-Week Recap: Insightful Progress Reports**  
**Purpose:**  
The weekly recap serves as a reflection tool, summarizing the user's achievements and helping them identify areas for growth. It fosters self-awareness and motivates users to stay consistent.

**Key Features:**  
- **Progress Summary:**  
  - Total XP earned  
  - Streaks maintained  
  - Sessions completed  
  - Visual heatmaps displaying consistency  
- **Success Highlights:** Celebrating milestones and completed habits with motivational messages.
- **Weekly Goal Review:** Encourages users to adjust their upcoming week's goals for better alignment with long-term objectives.  

**Example:**  
*"This week, you maintained a 5-day streak for (habit name) and completed 4 sessions toward (goal name)! Keep it up!"*  

---

### **Integration with the Habit Loop**  
These automated features reinforce the habit loop (Cue, Craving, Response, Reward) by ensuring the user is continuously motivated and guided:  
- **Cue:** Daily reminders act as clear prompts.  
- **Craving:** Success stories and progress recaps build desire to achieve more.  
- **Response:** Adaptive goals make taking action easier.  
- **Reward:** End-of-week recaps and milestone celebrations provide satisfying rewards.

- **User Empowerment:** Rather than punishing missed sessions, the app focuses on encouragement and growth, fostering long-term behavior change.
