# User Persona

[Based on this article.](https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/ux-design/how-to-define-a-user-persona/)

## How to define User Persona?

A persona clarifies who is in your target audience by answering the following questions:
- Who is my ideal customer?
- What are the current behaviour patterns of my users?
- What are the needs and goals of my users?
- What issues and pain points do they currently face within the given context?

### Ideal customer
My ideal client is a student looking for ways to develop new habits.
He is interested in various methods and wants to find the motivation to implement his plans.

### Current behaviour patterns
My application’s users need help with bulding habits.
They get bored quickly, and are easily distracted.
My users’ typical behaviour is to find the short-term motivation to learn, start learning the material without any plan,
and end up stuck with a stack of books.

### Needs and Goals
- Adaptable Learning Techniques: They are looking for methods to keep them engaged and help them absorb information more effectively.
- Sustainable Motivation: They want to find intrinsic motivation that keeps them dedicated to their learning goals over the long term, not just when they are initially excited or under pressure.
- Efficient Time Management: They seek ways to maximise their learning in shorter periods, allowing them time for other activities and reducing the risk of burnout.
- Practical Implementation Plans: They need clear, actionable plans that guide them from the initial enthusiasm of learning new material to successful comprehension and application.

### Issues and Pain Points
- Lack of Engagement: The primary issue is their inability to remain engaged with the material for extended periods.
- Ineffective Study Habits: With a structured plan, users start learning with clear objectives and milestones, leading to effective studying and retention.
- Overwhelming and Stress: Starting with enthusiasm but needing a clear plan often leads to feeling overwhelmed by the sheer volume of material.
- Inconsistency in Learning: Fluctuating motivation levels lead to inconsistent learning habits.
Users may go through bursts of intense studying followed by periods of complete disengagement, which is detrimental to long-term learning.

## User Persona

### Header
**Name:** Alex Turner  
**Age:** 21  
**Occupation:** University Student  
**Location:** Urban University Campus

### Demographic Profile
Alex is a 21-year-old university student majoring in Environmental Science.
He lives in a student dorm in a bustling university town.
Alex is tech-savvy, frequently uses social media, and is always on the lookout for new apps and tools to
enhance his learning experience.
He's part of a study group but often finds himself losing focus and motivation, especially when studying alone.

### End Goal(s)
1. **Sustainable Motivation:** He aims to cultivate a deep-seated motivation for learning that persists beyond initial enthusiasm or external pressures.
2. **Efficient Time Management:** Alex wants to optimize his study sessions to absorb more in less time, allowing for a balanced lifestyle with leisure and social activities.
3. **Practical Implementation Plans:** He needs a structured approach to learning, with clear, actionable steps to progress from understanding new concepts to applying them effectively.

### Scenario
Alex often starts his study sessions with high energy and good intentions but finds himself quickly distracted by
social media, friends, or simply daydreaming.
This pattern has led to cramming sessions the night before exams, which, while sometimes effective in the short term,
leaves him feeling burnt out and dissatisfied with his depth of understanding.
After discovering an app promising to address these challenges, Alex is hopeful but skeptical, having tried various
methods with limited success.
He's looking for a solution that can adapt to his dynamic study habits, keep him consistently engaged, and provide
a structured pathway to achieve his academic goals without feeling overwhelmed or stressed.
