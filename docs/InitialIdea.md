# Engineering Project

An online RPG game that facilitates effective habit-building.

## Introduction

The world is inexorably moving forward. There are more and more things weighing on our minds.
Personal development is a crucial aspect of our lives. We need to find the time and willingness to do hard things.
We cannot determine our motivation because it is unreliable. 
Our work must be automated; we must not be reluctant to do it or wonder if we want to.
We need to sit down and do our work. How can we do it? Nowadays, we can describe a habit and how to develop it.
This project is designed to build habits critical to achieving our goals.

## Atomic Habits by James Clear

[Atomic Habits Summary](https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits-summary)

Building a habit can be divided into four simple steps: cue, craving, response, and reward.

The cue triggers a craving, which motivates a response, which provides a reward, which satisfies the craving and,
ultimately, becomes associated with the cue.

How to create a good habit:
- The 1st law (Cue): Make it obvious.
- The 2nd law (Craving): Make it attractive.
- The 3rd law (Response): Make it easy.
- The 4th law (Reward): Make it satisfying.

## Okay, but what does this do with the game?
Why is the game the best tool for developing the habit of everyday learning?

### The 1st law (Cue)
The book clearly states:
- We cannot forget about our habits.
- It is essential to maintain a streak of performing the habit.
- Memory is unreliable, so we need reminders.

The applications themselves remind you of their existence.
- Notifications are hard to miss because everyone has a phone at hand these days.
- Notifications only disappear once we move them manually.
- Additionally, the game may have a daily streak, a heatmap (similar to GitHub), daily challenges and more.

These things make it easier to remember about the game.

### The 2nd law (Craving)
Learning is boring because:
- We are overloaded with information.
- Learning is monotonous.
- Distractions everywhere.
- We need to find methods of effective learning.

Video games are fun because of the following:
- Interactivity
- Imagination
- Challenges and achievements
- Community and competition
- Storytelling

### The 3rd law (Response)
Learning things is difficult because:
- No one taught us how to learn
- We have no motivation
- We feel pressure and stress
- We are too tired

How to learn new things?
- Learn using well known techniques
- Be sure to take notes
- Set small steps/achievements
- Set deadlines
- Follow Bloom's Teaching Taxonomy
- Learn by teaching others
- Use your knowledge in practice

### The 4th law (Reward)

- Learning neither shows progress nor rewards us.
- We pass an exam, and then another exam, and then another, there is no end in sight.
- We finish our education and get a reward in the form of a job.
- If we want an achievement system, we have to build it ourselves.

It isn't fun at all, but I found a solution.

Progression and rewards are an integral part of games:

- Game progress is visible immediately.
- The games can be competitive.
- We are rewarded for pushing forward.
- The games are satisfying.
